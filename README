In Ireland we have geographic and non-geographic telephone numbers. A geographic number has a prefix that indicates where in the country that number originates. Non-geographic numbers have no such geographic tie.

1890 numbers are non-geographic. They've become very popular with businesses since presumably they look more professional and are normally easy to remember. Unfortunately the problem is that non-geographic numbers are never included in the free calls packages that telecom companies offer.

The aim of this project is to create a Firefox plugin that decorates 1890 numbers with their geographic alternative.
